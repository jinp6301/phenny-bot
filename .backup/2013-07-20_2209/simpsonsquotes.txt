“…A fabulous, frabulous, zip-zop-zabulous present!”
“LISA NEEDS BRACES.”
“They’re defending themselves somehow!”
“I need it all, Marge: the terrifying lows, the dizzying highs, the creamy middles.

Where was I? Oh yeah! Stay out of my booze.”
“DENTAL PLAN.”
“Come on; my children need wine!”
“Bart, with $10,000, we’d be millionaires! We could buy all kinds of useful things like… love.”
“Okay, Mr. Burns, what’s your first name?” “...I do-oon’t… know.”
“…What the hell was that?!”
“When you get to Hell, tell em’ Itchy sent ya.”
“Oh, I’ve wasted my life.”
